Studies with arrays using get and set funcions.

1. The program starts with crating meal objects (appetizers, mains and desserts) as empty arrays;

2. Get function will take this objects as parameters for a later use;

3. Set function transforms the objects taken with 'get' into new names for a later transformation;

4. courses() return the value of the '_courses' objects using this keyword;

5. addDishToCourse use courseName, dishName and dishPrice as parameters to change the dish objects, and name and price are evalueted to dishName and dishPrice.
_courses will take courseName as parameter to push dish into the array;

6. getRandomDishFromCourse function uses coursename as parameter to change dishes and randomIndex and then return the value of dishes in randomized way;

7. generateRandomMeal function will automatically generate a three-course meal for us, by creating appetizer variable as the result of calling the getRandomDishFromCourse() method, when we passa appetizers string to it. It will do the same with the mains and desserts, respectivelly;

8. addDishToCourse() function will create a menu by adding some appetizers, mains and desserts. 

9. By the end, we can have a randomized menu, with random options and the sum of their values.
